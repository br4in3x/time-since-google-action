# Google Action Time Since

This simple action is my attempt to play with Google Assistant actions in Golang. It can tell you how many days have passed since a certain date, or how many days between two dates.

This action should be deployed as an HTTP server, for example, on Heroku. It acts as a simple REST API responding on Google's requests with valid JSON.
